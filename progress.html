                  	<p>Ontime started with the idea of managing tasks and habits. I wanted to make something that would motivate me towards finishing my task and give me a reason to continue. I tried several apps on the play story but their busy UI made me uninstall it.
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        I started with doing sketches for the UI.
                        
                    <a class="image fit"><img src="images/Progress/app1.jpg" alt=""/></a>
                        
                    <p1>I tried out different names, testing them out and checking if it isnt taken</p1>
                        
                    <a  class="image fit"><img src="images/Progress/Logoname.jpg" alt="" /></a>
                        
                    <p2>I finalized on the name Ontime. The idea behind this name was when using the app, you can be on time. Once i got the name down, i started to work on the logo</p2>
                        
                        <a  class="image fit"><img src="images/Progress/logo.jpg" alt="" /></a>
                        
                    <p3>Started with doing more sketches before moving on to the computer for UI </p3>
                        
                        <a  class="image fit"><img src="images/Progress/appui.jpg" alt="" /></a>
                        
                    <p4>I started with Adobe XD as it was an software i was very familar with. I started out with picking the colours for the app and picked red and navy. Red was attractive and is associated with energy and power. Navy represented stability and confidence.</p4>
                        
                        <a  class="image fit"><img src="images/Progress/firstloginhome.png" alt="First login screen"/></a>
                        
                        <p5>The first iteration was a challenge because it was only my second time designing an app. I had to look up tons of tutorials on youtube and looking at dozens of app for inspiration.</p5>
                        
                        <a  class="image fit"><img src="images/Progress/first%20home%20screen.png" alt="First home screen"/></a>
                        
                        <p6> I went off to creating the first few screens of the app and testing out the auto-animate tool on XD. I wanted a simple and minimalistic design while keeping the app colors.</p6>
                        
                        <a  class="image fit"><img src="images/Progress/first%20screens.png" alt="First screens"/></a>
                        
                        <a  class="image fit"><img src="images/Progress/xp.png" alt="XP screen"/></a>
                        
                        <p7>Creating the progress screen was challenging as i wanted as much information while keeping it simple, but in the first iteration it was very busy so i had to delete and start over afterwards.</p7>
                        
                        <a  class="image fit"><img src="images/Progress/first%20progress.png" alt="First Progress"/></a>
                        
                        <p8> I went back to the drawing board, creating wireframes at first and testing out different UI styles.</p8>
                        
                        <a  class="image fit"><img src="images/Progress/wireframe.png" alt="Wireframe"/></a>
                        
                        <p9>I also went to recolor the logo as the red and glue was very bright and using it to keep the UI simple was tough. I wanted a color that would not attract attention, a color that was minimalistic</p9>
                        
                        
                        <br>
                        
                        <div class="square1"></div>
                        <p10 style="color: #FAB829"> #FAB829</p10>
                    
                        <div class="square2"></div>
                        <p11 style="color: #2992A5"> #2992A5</p11>
                    
                    <br>
                    
                    <p12>Yellow is the color of sunshine, hope, and happiness. This was the accent colors and the main colors for the dark mode i planned. The second color was a mix or blue and light sea green. Green represents freshness while blue represents loyalty, faith and confidence. It also represents calmness and is used to calm people down.</p12>
                    
                    <p13>I looked at many different app login screens it was starting to come together.</p13>
                    
                    <a  class="image fit"><img src="images/Progress/secondlogin.png" alt="second login"/></a>
                    
                    <a  class="image fit"><img src="images/Progress/secondscreens.png" alt="second screen"/></a>
                    
                    <p14>The app was coming together, still missing some of the colours as it looked dull.</p14>
                    
                    <a  class="image fit"><img src="images/Progress/secondscreens.png" alt="Calendar"/></a>
                    
                    <p15> The adding task and habits screen started to look like the final version while missing a few things that required tweaking.</p15>
                    
                     <a  class="image fit"><img src="images/Progress/addingtask.png" alt="addingtask"/></a>
                    
                    <p16> As i got the second iteration done, i could start on tweaking it and adding some other features and the accent colors. I added in a optional dark mode that the user could toggle.</p16>
